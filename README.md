Names and Colours are straight out of the profile.cpf File.

"Enemy_Hero" are Guy of Guisbourne, Longchamp, Scathlock and Sheriff of Nothingham in that Order.

"Unit_Block_Head" is a base 64 Encoding of the Name and Colour etc. because it caused some issues in the Code with Carriage Return and New Line Feed interpretations of the Bytes

You can Only Change Values inside Unit Blocks, not the name or the colour of them.
Also don't try to change the Unit_Block_Head base 64 encoding probably.
